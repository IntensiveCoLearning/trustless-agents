## Learning Materials/Course Schedule

### **Module 1: The Trust Foundation — ERC-8004 Identity & Reputation Layer**

- In-depth analysis of the ERC-8004 standard: Identity Registry, Reputation Registry, and Verification Registry.
- Hands-on: Create an on-chain identity for your agent and implement a simple off-chain reputation feedback mechanism.

**Resources:**
- [EIP-8004 Official Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)
- [Ethereum Magicians - ERC-8004 Discussion](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098)

### **Module 2: The Collaboration Language — A2A Architecture & AP2 Protocol**

- Master how agents autonomously discover and communicate via the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) architecture.
- Decode the AP2 protocol: Understand agent descriptor files, capability declarations, and interaction flows.
- Hands-on: Enable your agent to discover other agents and initiate collaboration requests.

**Resources:**
- [A2A Protocol Official Site](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/)

### **Module 3: The Value Engine — x402 Payment Protocol**

- Dissect how the x402 protocol utilizes the HTTP 402 status code to enable "gasless" micro-payments.
- Integrate EIP-3009 to achieve automated settlement for agent services and resource access control.
- Hands-on: Integrate x402 payment functionality into your agent service, enabling "pay-per-call".

**Resources:**
- [X402 Protocol - Official Website](https://www.x402.org/)
- [X402 Protocol - GitBook Documentation](https://x402.gitbook.io/x402)

- [Coinbase Developer - X402 Integration](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/x402)

### **Module 4: Capstone Project — Building an Autonomous Agent**

- Integrate knowledge from the first three modules to build a full-lifecycle Trustless Agent.
- Implement the full automated workflow: from identity registration and reputation accumulation to autonomous collaboration and service settlement.
- Project Demo & Code Review: share your project with the community and get feedback.

**Some Project Examples:**

ERC-8004 Trustless Agents Example <https://github.com/vistara-apps/erc-8004-example>.

Arena SDK with 8004 identities + A2A + ChaosChain integration for receipt logged on-chain and payment released on verification. <https://github.com/vistara-apps/agent-arena-v1>

### 🎯 Learning Challenges & Discussion Questions

**Challenge 1: On-Chain vs Off-Chain Data**

**Question**: The community debates how much data to put on-chain. If you had to choose between "events only" vs "minimal view functions" vs "full on-chain indexing," which would you pick and why?

**Challenge 2: Agent Identity System**

**Question**: Should ERC-8004 use domains, URLs, ENS, or DIDs for agent identity? What are the trade-offs of each approach?

**Challenge 3: Reputation Design**

**Question**: How would you design a reputation system that avoids a single score but still provides useful information for users?

**Challenge 4: Verification Methods**

**Question**: Which verification approach would you trust more: TEE proofs, ZK proofs, or sampling/reexecution? Why?

**Challenge 5: Economic Incentives**

**Question**: Should ERC-8004 include payment mechanisms in the core standard, or keep them as external extensions?

**Welcome to add more challenges and questions!**

### Coding Challenge: Trustless Agent “Hello World”

**Objective**
Ship a minimal, runnable demo that proves identity, discovery, deterministic service, third-party validation, and optional tokenized pay-per-call.

**Build**

* Three agents:

  * **Server** provides a simple deterministic service over an input.
  * **Validator** independently recomputes and records a pass/fail outcome.
  * **Client** discovers the Server, invokes it, requests validation, then prints final status.
* Two tiny registries:

  * **Identity** links agent identifiers to JSON descriptors (name, version, tags, endpoints, optional price).
  * **Verification** stores validation outcomes tied to a service receipt.
* JSON descriptors for all agents.

**Flow**

1. Start a local chain.
2. Deploy registries and agents.
3. Register Server and Validator with descriptor URLs.
4. Client discovers Server by identifier or tag.
5. Client calls Server and receives a deterministic result plus a receipt reference.
6. Client asks Validator to verify; Validator records the outcome.
7. Client prints `STATUS: VERIFIED` or `FAILED`.

**Acceptance**

* Visible agent addresses, identifiers, and descriptor URLs.
* Identity entries exist.
* A receipt reference is produced.
* A verification record indicates success.
* Final console line shows `STATUS: VERIFIED`.

**Optional**

* Token pay-per-call.
* Tag-based discovery.
* Simple reputation counter on successful validations.
