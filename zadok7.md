## Self-introduction

In the 2000's everyone once talked of "everything going online". Now, we know, and believe that "everything is going onchain". It must, it will. Here for the paradigm shift. Early adopter of ENS protocol, ex-support & community manager. Long term believer in Ethereum and core principals of decentralization, transparency, and trustless human and technical collaboration.

## The 3 Trust Models Broken Down

### **Trust Model 1: Reputation**

-   **What it includes**: Client feedback scores (0-100)
    
-   **How it works**: Like Yelp/Uber ratings - clients rate the agent after task completion
    
-   **Validation method**: Social consensus
    
-   **Example**: “This agent has 4.8 stars from 1,200 reviews”
    

* * *

### **Trust Model 2: Crypto-economic (think money and math for trust-less)**

This model includes TWO validation methods:

**Method A: Stake-secured re-execution**

-   Validators stake money (e.g., $10,000 in ETH)
    
-   They re-run the agent’s computation to verify correctness
    
-   If they certify incorrectly, they lose their stake
    
-   Example: “3 validators staked $50K total and confirmed this result”
    

**Method B: zkML proofs**

-   Agent provides cryptographic proof it ran specific computation
    
-   Math guarantees the work was done correctly
    
-   Doesn’t reveal private inputs/data
    
-   Example: “Agent provided zero-knowledge proof that it processed your medical data using Model X”
    

* * *

### **Trust Model 3: TEE Attestation (think hardware based trust-less)**

-   **What it includes**: TEE oracles (secure hardware)
    
-   **How it works**: Code runs inside tamper-proof hardware (Intel SGX, AWS Nitro Enclaves)
    
-   Hardware cryptographically signs that specific code ran in isolated environment
    
-   Can’t be hacked or inspected, even by the server owner
    
-   **Example**: “Intel SGX/Nitro Enclaves attestation confirms agent ran in secure enclave”
    

## 3 Singletons

✅ **Identity Registry**  
✅ **Reputation Registry**  
✅ **Validation Registry**

Each blockchain gets ONE of each, Keeps fragmentation away. Network effect, and marketplace opportunities(all agents in one place).
