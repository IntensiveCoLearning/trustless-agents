## Self-introduction

In the 2000's everyone once talked of "everything going online". Now, we know, and believe that "everything is going onchain". It must, it will. Here for the paradigm shift. Early adopter of ENS protocol, ex-support & community manager. Long term believer in Ethereum and core principals of decentralization, transparency, and trustless human and technical collaboration.
