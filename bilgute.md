### ERC-8004: Problems It Solves

-   **Lack of standard identity for agents:**  
    Before ERC-8004, there wasnâ€™t a portable, verifiable, and censorship-resistant identity layer for AI agents to operate across networks or organizations.
    
-   **No trusted way to evaluate or verify agents:**  
    It solves the trust gap by introducing reputation and verification registries, allowing agents to be scored, verified, and held accountable.
    
-   **Fragmented agent ecosystems:**  
    Different platforms build isolated agent systems. ERC-8004 provides a unified, open standard so agents can discover and interact without pre-existing trust relationships.
