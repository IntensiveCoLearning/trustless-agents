**Recap of Days 1–2**

Day 1 focused on understanding what EIP-8004 is and why it matters (identity, reputation, validation).

Day 2 explored the trust layers — how these registries interact and how agents establish credibility.

Now, Day 3 introduces a simple hands-on workflow to simulate trustless agent behavior.

**Step 1 – Register an Agent**

Simulate registration by creating a JSON profile representing an agent’s metadata.

This mimics how an agent would mint an ERC-721 identity token with a tokenURI pointing to off-chain data.

The file defines the agent’s endpoints, description, and supported trust models.

**Step 2 – Discover and Interact**

As another agent, query the registry (or read mock profiles locally) to find potential partners.

Select based on trust preferences and simulate a task request such as data summarization or information retrieval.

Document this as a simple interaction flow.

**Step 3 – Validation Flow**

After a task, create a data hash representing the result.

Post a mock validation request and simulate how validators verify the work by re-execution, proof generation, or attestation.

Then record a response linking the validation request to its outcome.

**Step 4 – Reputation Feedback**

Once validation is complete, submit feedback such as a rating or comment.

Aggregate feedback from multiple clients to track how reputation evolves over time.

This helps illustrate how agents develop credibility through repeated verifiable interactions.

**Reflection**

Identity provides verifiable existence, validation ensures correctness, and reputation builds social trust.

Together they create a layered trust model for autonomous agents.

ERC-8004 does not dictate behavior — it defines the minimal primitives needed for an open agent ecosystem.

**Stretch Goals**

• Build a local mock registry using JSON or a minimal smart contract.

• Run a multi-agent simulation using different reputation or validation strategies.

• Explore how payment or staking logic could be attached to validation results.

**Focus:**  
Understanding _how trust actually forms_ between agents once the ERC-8004 primitives (identity, reputation, validation) are in place.

* * *

## **Key Concepts**

### **1\. Agent Identity in Practice**

-   Every agent = an **on-chain identity** (NFT entry in the Identity Registry).
    
-   Identity points to a **registration file (JSON)** stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave, etc.).
    
-   That file describes:
    
    -   The agent’s communication endpoints (A2A, MCP, etc.)
        
    -   The trust models it supports (e.g. reputation-based, crypto-economic, proof-based)
        
-   Agents can link to others across networks — creating **interoperable “agent namespaces.”**
    

_Learning:_ Identity isn’t just a name — it’s the anchor for capability discovery and trust bootstrapping.

* * *

### **2\. Trust Formation = 3 Layers**

| Layer | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Verifiable registration & metadata | “I can see this agent is real and published by X.” |
| Validation | Independent confirmation of outputs | “A validator checked this result — no cheating.” |
| Reputation | Social proof over time | “Other agents gave good feedback.” |

_Together they create multi-layered trust_ — from proof-of-existence to proof-of-performance.

* * *

### **3\. Validation Pathways**

Different **validation modes** are possible:

-   _Re-execution_: validators re-run the task and compare hashes.
    
-   _Attestation_: validators sign or prove correctness (e.g. ZK proof, TEE).
    
-   _Crypto-economic_: staked validators risk losing collateral if wrong.
    

Each has tradeoffs: gas cost, latency, and trust assumptions.

* * *

### **4\. Reputation Feedback Loop**

-   After task completion, the client agent submits **feedback** to the Reputation Registry.
    
-   Other systems (indexers, dashboards) can aggregate it into visible trust scores.
    
-   Feedback becomes a _social signal_ for agent reliability.
    

🗣️ _Idea:_ Over time, reputation graphs could resemble “PageRank for agents.”

* * *

### **5\. Off-Chain Coordination**

Most of the logic lives off-chain:

-   Discovery via metadata and subgraphs.
    
-   Feedback scoring via aggregators.
    
-   Validation execution via side networks (TEE, zk, staked nodes).
    

On-chain layer = minimal & composable → **“Ethereum as trust anchor.”**

* * *

## **Reflections / Takeaways**

-   Agents trust each other by combining **verifiable identity**, **independent validation**, and **peer reputation.**
    
-   ERC-8004 doesn’t enforce _how_ — it standardizes _where_ those records live.
    
-   The design encourages **ecosystem cooperation**, not monolithic systems.
    
-   True “trustless” coordination happens when validation + reputation are both verifiable & incentive-aligned.

## Trustless Agents (EIP-8004) — Study Notes

**Main idea:**  
A framework for _autonomous agents_ (AI bots, smart services, etc.) to **find, verify, and trust each other** on Ethereum — no middlemen, no pre-existing trust.

* * *

### Core Registries

-   **Identity Registry**: Each agent gets an **on-chain ID** (like a passport) + off-chain profile (endpoints, supported trust types).
    
-   **Reputation Registry**: Stores **feedback & ratings** from other agents. Off-chain systems can score or rank agents based on these entries.
    
-   **Validation Registry**: Records results of **independent checks** (re-execution, zk proof, TEE attestation, etc.) to confirm if work was done correctly.
    

* * *

### Typical Flow

1.  Agent registers (identity).
    
2.  Others discover & interact.
    
3.  Validators confirm results.
    
4.  Feedback builds reputation.
    

Everything gets tied together by minimal on-chain records + richer off-chain logic.

* * *

### Why?

-   Enables an **open, verifiable agent economy**.
    
-   Keeps Ethereum contracts light — trust logic happens mostly off-chain.
    
-   Flexible trust models (reputation, crypto-economic, proof-based).
    
-   Works across chains and organizations.
    

* * *

### Notes / Open Questions?

-   Preventing fake feedback (Sybil attacks).
    
-   Incentivizing honest validators.
    
-   Ensuring off-chain data (profiles, feedback) stays available.
    
-   How to link payment & reputation safely.
    

* * *

**Takeaway:**

ERC-8004 gives us the _identity, reputation, and validation primitives_ to build trustless coordination among agents — a first step toward a real decentralized “agent economy.”
