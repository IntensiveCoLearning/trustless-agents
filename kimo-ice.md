## Trustless Agents (EIP-8004) — Study Notes

**Main idea:**  
A framework for _autonomous agents_ (AI bots, smart services, etc.) to **find, verify, and trust each other** on Ethereum — no middlemen, no pre-existing trust.

* * *

### Core Registries

-   **Identity Registry**: Each agent gets an **on-chain ID** (like a passport) + off-chain profile (endpoints, supported trust types).
    
-   **Reputation Registry**: Stores **feedback & ratings** from other agents. Off-chain systems can score or rank agents based on these entries.
    
-   **Validation Registry**: Records results of **independent checks** (re-execution, zk proof, TEE attestation, etc.) to confirm if work was done correctly.
    

* * *

### Typical Flow

1.  Agent registers (identity).
    
2.  Others discover & interact.
    
3.  Validators confirm results.
    
4.  Feedback builds reputation.
    

Everything gets tied together by minimal on-chain records + richer off-chain logic.

* * *

### Why?

-   Enables an **open, verifiable agent economy**.
    
-   Keeps Ethereum contracts light — trust logic happens mostly off-chain.
    
-   Flexible trust models (reputation, crypto-economic, proof-based).
    
-   Works across chains and organizations.
    

* * *

### Notes / Open Questions?

-   Preventing fake feedback (Sybil attacks).
    
-   Incentivizing honest validators.
    
-   Ensuring off-chain data (profiles, feedback) stays available.
    
-   How to link payment & reputation safely.
    

* * *

**Takeaway:**

ERC-8004 gives us the _identity, reputation, and validation primitives_ to build trustless coordination among agents — a first step toward a real decentralized “agent economy.”
