# Validation Registry (Third-Party Verification Hooks)

## Why it matters

For high-risk tasks (fund movements, governance, settlements), **reputation alone isn’t sufficient**. The Validation Registry provides **generic hooks** so an agent can make “was this result independently verified?” **auditable on-chain**. Verification methods include **re-execution**, **TEE**, and **ZK**; the standard keeps methods abstract so you can upgrade or swap per scenario.

* * *

## Must-read

-   **EIP-8004 Validation hooks:** how to request validation and record results (abstracts re-exec/TEE/ZK).
    
-   **HashKey Capital (Agent Economy view):** how 8004 fits A2A/payment/agent coordination.
    

* * *

## Technical flow (short path)

**Caller (Agent or job contract)** → `requestValidation(jobRef, method)` → **External Verifier (staker/TEE/ZK verifier)** → `recordResult(jobRef, verdict, proofRef)`

-   **jobRef:** pointer to off-chain evidence (URI) + hash commitment
    
-   **method:** `"reexec" | "tee" | "zk"` (extensible)
    
-   **verdict:** boolean or 0–100 (protocol-defined)
    
-   **proofRef:** evidence URI + hash (ZK proof, TEE report, re-exec log)
    

* * *

## Three verification routes (trade-offs at a glance)

| Method | Strengths | Costs/Constraints | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Re-execution (sampling) | Simple, low cost, fast to adopt | Limited coverage, not crypto-strong | Routine QA, low–mid risk tasks |
| TEE (Trusted Execution Env.) | Low latency, private data friendly | Hardware trust & supply-chain assumptions | Real-time, sensitive data |
| ZK (Zero-Knowledge) | Strong composability & crypto guarantees | Proof generation/verification cost, engineering complexity | High-risk, zkML/strong verifiability |

> 8004 doesn’t lock you in—it abstracts the method so you can mix, switch, and upgrade.

* * *

## Reference interface (conceptual, implementation-friendly)

```solidity
// Request validation
function requestValidation(
  bytes32 jobRef,        // Commitment to the job/result (URI + hash)
  bytes32 methodTag,     // reexec / tee / zk
  string  requestUri,    // Inputs/context for the validator
  bytes32 requestHash
) external returns (uint256 requestId);

// Record the result
function recordResult(
  uint256 requestId,
  uint8   verdict,       // 0/1 or 0..100
  string  proofUri,      // ZK proof, TEE attestation, re-exec logs
  bytes32 proofHash,
  string  tag            // Optional: model=v1, dataset=foo, etc.
) external;

```

(_Use the actual EIP definitions/implementation names in production._)

* * *

## Relationship to A2A/MCP/Reputation

-   **A2A/MCP:** how agents **communicate** and expose **capabilities**
    
-   **Validation:** whether results are **independently verified**
    
-   **Reputation:** **aggregates signals** (including validation outcomes & client feedback)
    
    Together they form the **discover → interact → trust** loop for agent economies.
    

* * *

## Advanced patterns (zkML / TEE)

-   **zkML:** Agent completes inference → produces ZK proof (input/weights committed) → on-chain verifier checks → `recordResult` logs proof & verdict → triggers insurance/reputation gates.
    
-   **TEE:** Agent executes inside a TEE → remote attestation (quote) → verifier contract checks → `recordResult`; great for **low-latency** pipelines like matching/market-making.
    

* * *

## When you should **require** Validation

-   Any workflow that **releases funds** or **changes governance/state** (liquidations, payouts, parameter changes)
    
-   **High-value data products** (pricing signals, audit findings, forensics)
    
-   **Multi-agent hand-offs** as **gates**: no release until validation passes
    

* * *

## Economics (minimal sketch)

-   **Staking/slashing:** validators stake; bad results can be challenged and slashed; correct results earn fees.
    
-   **Insurance/guarantees:** payouts unlock only if results are validated with specific `methodTag` and trusted validators.
    
    (_These live outside 8004;_ `recordResult` _events are the integration points._)

# Reputation Registry

**Objective:** Avoid the “single score” anti-pattern; build a **composable, multi-dimensional** reputation model.

* * *

## Recommended 3 Dimensions (common for security/audit/agents)

-   **Reliability (Completion Rate):** Tasks delivered on-spec and on-time.
    
-   **Consistency (Reconciliation):** Output matches verifiable sources (recompute/TEE/zk).
    
-   **Performance:** Latency percentiles (P50/P95), cost/throughput.
    

> For risk/fraud: consider Precision/Recall instead of Performance.

* * *

## Event → Score Mapping (templates)

### A) Reliability (Completion Rate)

-   **Events:** `TaskCompletedOnTime` / `TaskLate(<10%)` / `TaskLate(≥10%)` / `TaskRejected`
    
-   **Scores:**
    
    -   On-time: **100**
        
    -   Slightly late (<10% SLA): **80**
        
    -   Heavily late (≥10% SLA): **40**
        
    -   Rejected: **0** (tag: `spec-mismatch`)
        
-   **Aggregation:** `score = EMA(last_N, decay=0.9)`
    

### B) Consistency (Reconciliation)

-   **Events:** `ProofVerified(zk|tee|recompute)` / `ProofFailed` / `NoProof`
    
-   **Scores:**
    
    -   `zk` verified: **100**
        
    -   `tee` verified: **90**
        
    -   `recompute` verified: **80**
        
    -   Failed: **20** (tag: `proof-fail`)
        
    -   No proof: **60**
        
-   **Weighting by strength:** `zk:1.0, tee:0.9, recompute:0.8, none:0.6`
    

### C) Performance

-   **Events:** `LatencyMeasured(ms)`, `CostMeasured($/100 calls)`
    
-   **Scores (example):**
    
    -   Latency: P50 ≤ 500ms → **90**; 500–1500ms → linearly down to **60**; >1500ms → **40**
        
    -   Cost: ≤ baseline → **+10**; 1–2× → **0**; >2× → **−10**
        
-   **Aggregation:** `perf = clamp(latency_score + cost_adj, 0, 100)`
    

* * *

## Data Design (minimal, production-friendly)

**Off-chain (IPFS/Arweave recommended):** full feedback JSON

```
{
  "dimension": "reliability|consistency|performance",
  "event": "TaskCompletedOnTime|ProofVerified|LatencyMeasured",
  "raw": { "p50": 420, "p95": 1350, "cost_per_100": 0.72 },
  "score": 86,
  "tags": ["dim:performance","p95","low-cost"],
  "evidence_uri": "ipfs://.../feedback.json",
  "evidence_hash": "0x...",
  "client": "0xClient...",
  "agentId": 123,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T09:00:00Z"
}
```

**On-chain (ERC-8004 Reputation):**

-   `giveFeedback(agentId, score, tag1, tag2, uri, hash, feedbackAuth)`
    
-   `tag1/tag2` examples: `dim:reliability | dim:consistency | dim:performance`, `p95 | zk | tee | spec-mismatch`
    

* * *

## Aggregation & UI (practical)

-   **Radar chart:** three axes (0–100).
    
-   **Scenario weights:**
    
    -   Matching/Trading: `w_perf=0.5, w_rel=0.3, w_cons=0.2`
        
    -   Audit/Forensics: `w_cons=0.6, w_rel=0.3, w_perf=0.1`
        
-   **Optional overall rank:** `overall = Σ (w_i * dim_i)` (for sorting only; never replace dimension view).
    
-   **Time decay:** `weight = exp(-λ * age_days)` (e.g., λ = 0.02).
    

* * *

## Anti-Abuse & Trust (minimum controls)

-   **Pre-authorization:** accept feedback only with agent-issued `feedbackAuth`.
    
-   **Rater weighting:** whitelist/stake-weighted `clientAddress` (partners, auditors, KOLs).
    
-   **Spot checks:** sample high-impact scores for `ProofVerified`.
    
-   **Data minimization:** on-chain = score + index (URI+hash); keep sensitive data off-chain.

# Identity Registry Learning Notes

## Today’s Goals

-   Understand the design principle of **“on-chain minimalism, off-chain richness.”**
    
-   Learn how **ERC-721 +** `tokenURI` serves as an **identity anchor.**
    
-   Develop your project’s **ID naming strategy** (trade-offs among ENS / DID / URL / Domain).
    

## Key Concepts

-   **Minimize on-chain data:**  
    Only store verifiable pointers and ownership on-chain.  
    Keep all other capabilities, keys, endpoints, and payment options off-chain (in a JSON descriptor).
    
-   **Identity as NFT:**  
    Each `tokenId` = one agent identity.  
    `ownerOf(tokenId)` = controller of that identity.
    
-   `tokenURI` **as the source of truth:**  
    Points to an off-chain file (IPFS / Arweave / HTTPS).  
    May contain public keys, service capabilities, payment options, and cross-references (ENS / DID / URL / Domain).
    
-   **Versioning and rotation:**  
    Append `?v=date` or `#v=commit` for auditability.  
    Key rotation records are stored off-chain, while updates are announced via on-chain events.
    
-   **Portability and interoperability:**  
    Maintain at least one **Primary ID** and a **mapping table** to avoid vendor lock-in by any single naming system.
    

## Interface and Flow (Conceptual)

-   **Interface:**  
    `registerAgent(agent, uri) → tokenId`;  
    `tokenURI(tokenId)`;  
    `ownerOf(tokenId)`;  
    Events: `AgentRegistered`, `AgentURIUpdated`.
    
-   **Flow:**  
    Registration → Query `tokenURI` to retrieve the Agent Card → Emit update events for indexers upon data changes.
    

## Security and Governance Notes

-   **Ownership control:** Only `ownerOf(tokenId)` can update the `uri`.
    
-   **Availability:** Ensure long-term accessibility of the JSON (`IPFS + pin`, `Arweave`, or version-controlled HTTPS).
    
-   **Auditability:** JSON should include version, publish time, and previous hash; emit events to mark version updates.
    
-   **Compatibility:** Reserve ENS/DID fields and consider multi-chain mirror URIs.
    
-   **Privacy:** Only expose public keys/endpoints; keep sensitive keys or credentials hashed or signed, not in plaintext.
    

## Your Project’s “5-Line Naming Strategy” (Replace with your own)

1.  **Primary ID:** Choose one (ENS / DID / URL / Domain) as your main external identifier.
    
2.  **Mapping:** Maintain a mapping table and verification method (signature/TXT record) for 2–3 other identifiers in `descriptor.json`.
    
3.  **URI Policy:** `tokenURI` points to IPFS (primary) + HTTPS (backup), with versioned filenames (e.g., `card.v2025-10-15.json`).
    
4.  **Versioning Standard:** Each update must include `version`, `prev_hash`, and `changelog`, and emit `AgentURIUpdated` on-chain.
    
5.  **Key Rotation:** JSON maintains `keys[{kid, use, alg, jwk_fingerprint, valid_from, valid_to, rotate_sig}]`.
    

## Example: `descriptor.json` (Structure Sample — Customize as Needed)

```
{
  "id_primary": "ens:youragent.eth",
  "mappings": {
    "did": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xYourAddr",
    "url": "https://agents.example.com/youragent",
    "domain": "youragent.example.com"
  },
  "version": "2025-10-15",
  "prev_hash": "0x...",
  "capabilities": ["translate.v1", "route.v1"],

## 10/16 Workshop Summary — ERC-8004

### 1\. Core Objective

-   **ERC-8004** addresses the challenge of **AI agent discovery and trust** in decentralized economies.
    
-   It introduces three foundational registries that allow agents to **register identity**, **receive feedback**, and **validate their work**.
    
-   The goal is to create a **neutral information layer** on which developers and ecosystems can build their own applications.
    

* * *

### 2\. Identity Registry

-   Implemented using **ERC-721 (NFT standard)** — each registered agent receives a unique **Token ID (Agent ID)**.
    
-   The on-chain record stores a **URI** pointing to an off-chain JSON (e.g., on IPFS) that contains:
    
    -   Agent name, description, image
        
    -   Communication endpoints (A2A Gateway, MCP endpoint, etc.)
        
    -   Wallet address and metadata
        
-   Supports mapping with **ENS / DID / Wallets**.
    
-   Owners can **transfer** agents and **delegate operators** for URI updates and maintenance.
    

* * *

### 3\. Reputation Registry

-   Works like a **decentralized feedback system**:
    
    -   Clients can score agents from **0–100**.
        
    -   Before submitting feedback, a client must obtain a **signed “Feedback Authorization”** from the agent to prevent spam.
        
    -   Supports **custom tags** and **off-chain files** for richer context (e.g., proof of service).
        
-   Clients **don’t need to register** to leave feedback — enabling **gas-sponsored user experiences**.
    
-   The community is encouraged to build **indexing layers** (e.g., **The Graph Subgraphs**) to aggregate and query reputation data efficiently.
    
-   Potential use cases include:
    
    -   Decentralized reputation systems
        
    -   Game-like trust and collaboration models among AI agents
        

* * *

### 4\. Validation Registry

-   Enables **provable trust mechanisms** beyond simple reputation.
    
-   **Workflow:**
    
    1.  Agent submits a **Validation Request** to a validator smart contract, with off-chain payload.
        
    2.  The validator responds with a **validation score (0–100)**.
        
-   Three supported models:
    
    1.  **Full On-Chain Verification:** Entire request + attestation stored and verified on-chain (gas-intensive).
        
    2.  **TEE Oracle Model:** A trusted TEE Oracle performs the attestation check off-chain and signs the result.
        
    3.  **Public Key Registry Model:** Only verifies TEE-generated public keys — the envisioned direction for scalable, trust-minimized validation.
        
-   Compatible with **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, and **Stake-Secured Inference**.
    
-   Supports **privacy-preserving validation** depending on implementation.
    

* * *

### 5\. Technical Implementation

-   Smart contracts are **deployed on the Sepolia testnet** and **open-sourced on GitHub**.
    
-   Supports **ERC-1271 (smart-contract wallet signatures)**.
    
-   Enables **gas-less user experiences**.
    
-   Built with an **event-based architecture**, making it index-friendly for tools like **The Graph**.
    
-   **Community SDKs** are available for developers to interact directly with the registries.
    

* * *

### 6\. Deployment and Governance

-   The goal is to maintain **singleton registries per network**.
    
-   The **Ethereum Foundation** will coordinate deployments across **mainnet**, **Layer-2s**, and **other L1s**.
    
-   Initial deployments will use a **multi-sig distributed governance** model.
    
-   **No single entity** will control production keys.
    
-   Mainnet deployment expected around **late October**, pending community feedback.
    

* * *

### 7\. Privacy and Data Security

-   Several privacy-preserving methods are under discussion:
    
    -   **ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning):** Reveals only input/output, hides internal data.
        
    -   **Stake-Secured Inference:** Public computations backed by staked collateral.
        
    -   **TEE-based validation:** Relies on hardware-based isolation for private computations.
        
-   Off-chain storage options include **IPFS**, **HTTPS**, and other content-addressable schemes.
    

* * *

### 8\. Community and Ecosystem

-   The ERC-8004 community now includes **~750 members** contributing SDKs and tools.
    
-   Developers are encouraged to test the **reference implementation on Sepolia** and provide feedback.
    
-   Collaborations are underway with projects like **File Network, AIGLayer, and ChaosChain** to advance **TEE and ZK standardization**.
    

* * *

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

-   **ERC-8004** lays the foundation for **AI agent interoperability, discovery, and verifiable trust** in decentralized networks.
    
-   By registering agents as NFTs and combining **feedback** with **provable validation**, it creates a trust layer for autonomous AI economies.
    
-   The standard is still **early-stage**, but it provides a clear blueprint for the next generation of **open, AI-driven Web3 ecosystems**.
    
-   Developers and researchers are encouraged to join the community, test the framework, and contribute to its evolution.

ERC-8004 Overview & Trust Layer Primer

Objective (today)

\- Understand **what ERC-8004 is solving**, its **three registries** (Identity / Reputation / Validation), and the **“events-first”** design.

\---

Why ERC-8004 (problem framing)

Modern agents need to discover each other, establish minimal trust, and settle outcomes across org or platform boundaries. ERC-8004 proposes a **credibly neutral trust layer** on Ethereum so agents can be **discovered, chosen, verified, and audited** without pre-existing trust. It does this by standardizing on-chain registries while pushing complex scoring and analytics off-chain for flexibility.

ERC-8004 — Three Registries (Implementation-Oriented Explainer)

1.  **Identity Registry**
    

What (Purpose)  
Provide each agent with a portable, censorship-resistant on-chain identifier. Keep the on-chain footprint minimal (a pointer), and store rich metadata off-chain (Agent Card/descriptor, DID doc, JSON).

How (Data model)

-   ERC-721 + URIStorage: each tokenId = one agent identity
    
-   tokenURI(tokenId) points to a registration file describing capabilities, endpoints, public keys, payment options, etc.
    
-   Off-chain file may include mappings across identifiers (ENS/DID/URL/Domain). On-chain keeps only the primary URI.
    

Minimal Interface (example)  
interface IIdentityRegistry {  
event AgentRegistered(address agent, uint256 tokenId, string uri);  
event AgentURIUpdated(uint256 tokenId, string oldUri, string newUri);

```
function registerAgent(address agent, string calldata uri)
    external returns (uint256 tokenId);

function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
}
```

Typical Flow

1.  Caller invokes registerAgent(agent, uri) → mints an ERC-721 as the identity anchor
    
2.  Anyone calls tokenURI(id) → fetches the off-chain Agent Card (descriptor/public keys/services)
    
3.  To update metadata, emit AgentURIUpdated so indexers can track versions
    

Design Notes

-   Primary ID + mapping table: choose ENS or DID as the primary; publish mappings to avoid lock-in
    
-   Versioning: append commit/version hints to the URI (e.g., …/card.json#v=2025-10-13) for auditability
    
-   Key rotation: keep rotation data/signatures in the off-chain file; restrict updates via ownerOf(tokenId)
    

* * *

2.  **Reputation Registry**
    

What (Purpose)  
Record interaction outcomes and quality signals as events (success/failure, latency percentiles, refund/dispute flags, settlement references). Avoid a single global score; enable a signal marketplace where third parties aggregate or weight differently.

How (Data model)

-   Prefer events as the canonical record of facts
    
-   Optionally expose a tiny set of view helpers (e.g., recent N entries) for convenience
    
-   Standardize event fields to make third-party indexing easy
    
-   Authorization flow: when the Server Agent accepts a task, it pre-authorizes the Client Agent to submit feedback after completion
    

```
Events & Interface (example)
interface IReputationRegistry {
event ReputationEvent(
bytes32 traceId,
address actor,
address counterparty,
string capability,
bool success,
uint64 latencyMsP95,
bytes32 paymentRef,
bytes32 integrityHash,
string evidenceURI
);
```

```
function emitReputation(
    bytes32 traceId,
    address actor,
    address counterparty,
    string calldata capability,
    bool success,
    uint64 latencyMsP95,
    bytes32 paymentRef,
    bytes32 integrityHash,
    string calldata evidenceURI
) external;

function getRecent(address agent, uint256 limit)
    external view returns (/* compact array type */);
}
```

Typical Flow

1.  After a call completes, your business/agent contract emits ReputationEvent
    
2.  Indexers pull events → warehouse (e.g., BigQuery/ClickHouse) → dashboards & KPIs
    
3.  External raters/auditors/insurers build scene-specific scores by weighting signals differently
    

Anti-abuse Tips

-   Sybil/self-dealing: perform graph analysis on counterparty; require validation evidence on a sample
    
-   Replay: enforce unique traceId/paymentRef; include nonce + deadline where applicable
    
-   Auditability: align integrityHash with (masked) input/output; host immutable evidenceURI (IPFS or versioned storage)
    

* * *

3.  **Validation Registry**
    

What (Purpose)  
Standardize independent verification: request checks by third parties (re-execution, ZK, TEE, human judges) and record results on-chain. Produce an auditable chain of evidence tied to a reputation record.

How (Data model)

-   Two-phase events: Request → Recorded Result
    
-   Identify method as an enum or string: "sampling" | "zk" | "tee" | "judge"
    

Interface (example)  
interface IValidationRegistry {  
enum Method { Sampling, ZK, TEE, Judge }

```
event ValidationRequested(
    bytes32 jobRef,
    address requestor,
    Method  method,
    string  evidenceURI
);

event ValidationRecorded(
    bytes32 jobRef,
    Method  method,
    bool    verdict,
    string  proofRef,
    bytes32 relatedHash
);

function requestValidation(
    bytes32 jobRef,
    Method method,
    string calldata evidenceURI
) external;

function recordValidation(
    bytes32 jobRef,
    Method method,
    bool verdict,
    string calldata proofRef,
    bytes32 relatedHash
) external;
}
```

Typical Flow

1.  Someone calls requestValidation(jobRef, method, evidenceURI) (buyer/auditor/policy bot)
    
2.  Validator runs off-chain (re-executes, builds ZK proof, produces TEE attestation, or renders judgment)
    
3.  Validator (or an authorized recorder) calls recordValidation → on-chain verdict/proofRef cross-linked via relatedHash
    

Security/Governance

-   Who can record? Whitelisted validators or staked sets subject to slashing
    
-   Evidence availability: proofRef must resolve (ZK proof, TEE quote/attestation, logs + hashes)
    
-   Sampling policy: e.g., 1/N random checks or mandatory for high-value/high-risk requests

How the Three Registries Work Together (End-to-End)

1.  Identity: agent registers → tokenURI → descriptor.json
    
2.  Interaction & Settlement: call service / pay (x402 / EIP-3009 etc.)
    
3.  Reputation: emit event with outcome, latency, paymentRef, integrityHash
    
4.  Validation (optional/sampled): request a check for jobRef/traceId → record verdict/proofRef
    
5.  Index & Aggregate: third parties combine Reputation + Validation to produce auditable scores and risk signals
