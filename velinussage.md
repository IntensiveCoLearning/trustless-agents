## Self-introduction

I'm building the coordination layer for the AI agent economy. Sage enables communities to create SubDAOs that own, govern, and monetize AI prompt libraries through on-chain governance.
My vision is to turn scattered prompts into valuable, governed assets that create new economic opportunities for creators and communities in the emerging AI coordination market.
We've developed a complete protocol with three governance modes, premium content encryption via Lit Protocol, and comprehensive economic incentives. Hoping to integrate ERC-8004 into the existing protocol deployed on Base Sepolia testnet.
