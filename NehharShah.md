I’m Nihar Shah, a full-stack engineer and researcher passionate about building intelligent agentic systems at the intersection of AI and Web3. I’ve worked at Starkware and Nethermind on LLM-integrated infrastructure, zero-knowledge systems, and scalable backend platforms in Python, TypeScript, and AWS. My focus is on creating AI agents that reason, execute, and integrate seamlessly with real-world systems.
