## **day1#ERC-8004: what and why?**

[**https://www.quillaudits.com/blog/smart-contract/erc-8004**](https://www.quillaudits.com/blog/smart-contract/erc-8004)

### What

ERC-8004 introduces three lightweight, on-chain registries that serve as the trust backbone for cross-organizational agent interactions.

ERC-8004 stores only essential trust-related data on-chain while delegating complex operations to off-chain infrastructure.

Three registries:

-   Identity Registry 
    
-   Reputation Registry
    
-   Validation Registry
    

### Why

-   The Trust Gap in Agent Communication
    
    -   A2A: agent communication
        
    -   ERC8004: agent trust
        
-   Economic importance
    
    -   Discovery Problem: discover reputable service providers across organizations
        
    -   Quality Assurance: verify the competence of service providers without prior interaction
        
    -   Reputation Portability: build and maintain reputation of agents across multiple platforms and organizations
        
    -   Validation Scalability: scale verification mechanisms from low-stakes to high-stakes interactions
