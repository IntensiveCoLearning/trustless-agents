I continue finishing blog posts from yesterday. I now kinda get that ERC-8004 was initially the extension of A2A. A2A has a "problem" that it requires "trust" within the system which ERC-8004 is trying to solve through a trustless networks.  
  
The goal is making the discovery and "reputation" and also "verification" to be on-chain (not all), so that it can become public and transparent. So there will be many tradeoffs in the process like what to put onchain vs offchain. And also making the ERC-8004 to be very minimal so that people can easily register. And the process later can be improved by protocols or dapps.  
  
I feel like running out of the time here. So maybe I won't read much about A2A and the x402. I will just see the overview and get dirty with the code for the remaining days.

this note is a diary rather than a informational note, for personal progress and note.  
  
I just finished reading all the discussion in ethereum magicians for ERC-8004, and I can't summarize things because I feel like the whole discussion is going left and right without any proper way to manage the flow of discussion. Unless I ignore most of the discussions, I can see the focus more on the on-chain data part (I can't go depth into it since I can't understand much).  
  
I am kinda not on the track, so I will see if I could finish the ERC-8004 resources by tomorrow. And then, jump into A2A and x402. I'm planning to make a proper plan for week 2 so I can have more time in the technical part. Because I feel like it will take a lot of time because it's totally new to me.  
  
My technical plan if possible is use any existing agent and play with the on-chain and off-chain interactions rather than developing the agent myself. Then I would love to see how both on-chain data and off-chain data can be used. And thinking of what can I improve or contribute to this ERC in the infra part.

almost done with the EIP discussion, few takeaways:  
\- it's a singleton (I just realized what does it mean), its literally one contract on each chain. so no need to deploy it multiple times  
\- I can understand some of the concern, but I also can understand the tradeoff and the scope focus  
  
ps, this is my first time reading almost everything from the ethereum magician discussions, and I can see the variety of people when discussing about this ERC.  
  
hopefully can finish it by tomorrow and then continue on the blog posts and VoD

slow progress on weekend, will go full on Monday. I just finished 25% of the ERC-8004 discussion. In overview, I could see the concern being discussed like what to put on-chain vs off-chain. also about scoring/reputation modularity. I don't really know much the detail but I think I can keep it up later.  
  
I would love to see the scoring or reputation in action.

I just finished reading the EIP-8004 but this note is not summary about it yet. It makes sense that the ERC-8004 uses existing standards/protocols such as MCP and A2A. And also it's pretty flexible and extendable into any other upcoming protocol as well.  
  
The Identity Registry is very simple and easy to understand. For the reputation registry, it's easy enough to understand but it's a bit unimaginable how it actually works in real-world case scenario on my end. It mentions about like the possibly of sybill attack etc which is possible and it lets the other protocol or dapp to handle it rather than ERC-8004 is the one who handling the rules about it.  
  
As for the Verification Registry, it's understandable but hard to imagine. I would love to see it in the real-world or even a very simple simulation on how it works for the "stake" and the other methods.  
  
Planning to continue on the EIP discussion, that is pretty long. And then on the VoD and blog posts.

I've listed all the resources I need for the upcoming 2 weeks but mostly it's from this page.  
  
Today I plan to mainly finish the EIP and read the discussion part. Hopefully can manage into the blog posts.

Also attended the sharing session, so glad to attend because I can see it directly how does it works

for today, I am planning to arrange the resources I will consume for this week. making sure that it's synced with the timeline from intensive co-learning. I'm focusing more on the theories, papers, and docs rather than building it myself.
