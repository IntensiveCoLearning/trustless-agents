I've listed all the resources I need for the upcoming 2 weeks but mostly it's from this page.  
  
Today I plan to mainly finish the EIP and read the discussion part. Hopefully can manage into the blog posts.

Also attended the sharing session, so glad to attend because I can see it directly how does it works

for today, I am planning to arrange the resources I will consume for this week. making sure that it's synced with the timeline from intensive co-learning. I'm focusing more on the theories, papers, and docs rather than building it myself.
