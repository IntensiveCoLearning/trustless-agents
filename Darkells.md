## Self-introduction

You'll never feel ready because ready isn't a feeling, it's a decision.

simple flow:

```
1. Check Identity (Identity Registry)
   Employer A queries Employee B’s AgentCard (resume-like profile).

2. Reputation Assessment (Reputation Registry)
   A reviews B’s ratings (client feedback + validation records).

3. Task Assignment (Off-chain + Validation Registry)
   A assigns task to B → B executes → Optional third-party validation.

4. Submit Feedback (Reputation Registry)
   A submits rating + comments (with signature verification).

5. Update Reputation (Reputation + Validation Registries)
   B’s rating is updated for future employers to reference.

6. Market Loop
   B improves services → New employers join → Community governance.
```

TODO Agent life cycle and version management

-   The official/reference design of ERC-8004 supports metadata updates on the same NFT Agent (including adding or removing endpoints, updating descriptions, supporting trust models, etc.).
    
-   It does not mandate that model upgrades require the minting of new Agent NFTs.
    
-   The actual method for model upgrades (replacing NFTs or updating metadata) is flexible within the standard and is determined by the specific system/implementer.
    
-   The mechanisms provided by the standard (such as setMetadata and tokenURI updates) are sufficient to support a variety of upgrade strategies.

This is a very cutting-edge, and for me, very challenging course. On the first day, I will start by understanding the main content of EIP-8004, which is essentially a 'reputation system'.
