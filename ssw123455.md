completing the A2A Python SDK Tutorial! learned how to:

\- Set up environment for A2A development.

\- Define \[\[Agent Skills and Agent Cards\]\] using the SDK's types.

\- Implement a basic HelloWorld A2A server and client.

\- acilent is handle `send message`and `recei` ,a main is handl`agent card and http host for meesage been send` ,a agent is handle `**CurrencyAgent**, manages the **RequestContext**, and enqueues status/artifact events. The LangGraph agent itself handles the LLM/tool reasoning.`

\- Understand and implement streaming capabilities.

\- Integrate a more complex agent using LangGraph, demonstrating task state management and tool use.

overlook a aquick introduce:

ERC‑8004 makes “autonomous negotiation, execution, and reputation-building” possible by adding a thin, blockchain‑anchored trust layer to the existing agent‑to‑agent protocol. Agents first register a portable identifier in the **Identity Registry**, which resolves to an off‑chain AgentCard describing capabilities and endpoints. Before or after a task, the server agent authorizes feedback via the **Reputation Registry**; the feedback itself stays off‑chain but is cryptographically linked to an on‑chain event, letting agents accumulate portable reputation across organizations. For higher‑stakes work, the **Validation Registry** lets third‑party validators re‑run computations, stake economic value that can be slashed, or provide TEE attestations—giving cryptographic or economic guarantees of correctness. Together, these three registries let unknown agents discover each other, negotiate work, verify outcomes, and persist reputation without any prior trust relationship.
