\## ERC-8004: Building a Trust Layer for Autonomous Agents in Web3

This note outlines the core principles, technical architecture, and significant advantages of ERC-8004, a protocol designed to establish a trust layer for autonomous agents within the Web3 ecosystem. It addresses the critical need for verifiable identity, reputation, and validation in agent-to-agent (A2A) and multi-agent communication protocols (MCP), thereby enabling a more robust, private, and integrated agent economy.

\### 1. Bridging the Trust Gap in Agent Communication

The fundamental challenge ERC-8004 tackles is the "trust gap" in agent communication, particularly when interactions occur between unknown parties. While existing protocols like A2A and MCP utilize JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for enterprise-grade transport security and access control within established organizations, they fall short when trust needs to be extended beyond pre-existing relationships.

ERC-8004 steps in by anchoring agent identities, authorizing feedback, and recording validation hooks on the blockchain. This enables:

\* **Continuous System Enhancement**: Linking the results of A2A/MCP executions to the system continuously strengthens its usability, while maintaining privacy and integration.

\* **Extended Trust**: JWTs secure session-level interactions, but ERC-8004's on-chain registration layer (Reputation and Validation Registries) provides a foundational trust mechanism for identity, reputation, and verification across unknown entities.

\* **Complete Task Lifecycle Orchestration**: The protocol enables a full lifecycle from agent discovery and negotiation to execution, verification, and reputation building.

\* **Scalability for Complex Work**: The more capable and complex the tasks, the more effectively this system can orchestrate and secure the work.

\### 2. The Core Trust Infrastructure: Three Interconnected Smart Contracts

ERC-8004's technical implementation revolves around three mutually reinforcing smart contracts, forming a robust trust infrastructure on the blockchain:

\* **Identity Registry**:

\* A minimal on-chain handle based on ERC-721 with the URIStorage extension.

\* It provides every agent with a portable, censorship-resistant identifier.

\* The `tokenURI` resolves to an agent's off-chain registration file (e.g., on IPFS), describing its capabilities and endpoints. Agents can be discovered through this URL.

\* **Reputation Registry**:

\* A standard interface for posting and fetching feedback signals.

\* It allows clients (human or agent) to `giveFeedback` to registered agents, typically after the agent has signed a `feedbackAuth` to authorize this.

\* Scoring and aggregation occur both on-chain (for composability with other smart contracts) and off-chain (for more sophisticated algorithms).

\* Feedback details (score, tags, file URI, file hash) are recorded on-chain via `NewFeedback` events, enabling an ecosystem of specialized services for agent scoring, auditor networks, and insurance pools.

\* **Validation Registry**:

\* Provides generic hooks for requesting and recording independent validator checks.

\* Agents or their operators can submit a `validationRequest` with a `requestUri` (pointing to off-chain data like inputs, outputs, logs) and an optional `requestHash` (for data commitment).

\* Designated validator smart contracts receive these requests and run their validation logic (e.g., stake-secured re-execution, zkML verification, TEE attestations, or trusted judge rules).

\* Validators then submit a `validationResponse` with a score (0-100) and optional evidence links. This process is decoupled from the agent's call, allowing for post-hoc checks, pre-delivery inspections, dispute resolution, or periodic audits.

\### 3. Key Advantages and Advanced Features

ERC-8004 introduces several powerful features that enhance the agent economy:

\* **On-chain Discoverability**: MCP and A2A execution results, along with agent capabilities, can be stored on-chain, making them widely discoverable.

\* **Cross-Chain Operations**: An agent registered and receiving feedback on one chain (e.g., Chain A) can still operate and transact on other chains, fostering a truly interoperable agent network. Agents can also register on multiple chains if desired.

\* **Flexible Agent Communication Protocols**: The protocol links from the blockchain to a flexible registration file, allowing for the inclusion of various endpoints and combining AI primitives (MCP, A2A) with Web3 primitives (wallet addresses, DIDs, and ENS names).

\* **Flexible Feedback Structure**: It leverages established nomenclature from A2A (tasks, skills) and MCP (tools, prompts) while offering complete flexibility in the structure of feedback signals.

\* **Gas Sponsorship**: By decoupling client registration, any application can implement frictionless feedback using EIP-7702, potentially sponsoring gas fees for users.

\* **Enhanced Indexing**: With feedback data saved on-chain and full data stored on IPFS, subgraphs can easily be leveraged to create indexers, significantly improving user experience (UX).

\* **Deployment Model**: Registries are expected to be deployed as singletons per chain, simplifying management and access.

\### Conclusion: The Convergence of Web3 and AI

ERC-8004 represents a pivotal step in applying core Web3 principles—permissionless, decentralization, censorship-resistance, and privacy-preservation—to the transformative field of AI. By providing a common, blockchain-anchored language and trust layer for humans and agents, it aims to solve the coordination problem in an emerging agent economy. This minimal yet powerful protocol enables visibility and data commitments on-chain, while leaving specific reputation calculation rules and trust thresholds to the broader ecosystem, fostering innovation and a truly autonomous, trusted agentic web.

overlook a aquick introduce:

ERC‑8004 makes “autonomous negotiation, execution, and reputation-building” possible by adding a thin, blockchain‑anchored trust layer to the existing agent‑to‑agent protocol. Agents first register a portable identifier in the **Identity Registry**, which resolves to an off‑chain AgentCard describing capabilities and endpoints. Before or after a task, the server agent authorizes feedback via the **Reputation Registry**; the feedback itself stays off‑chain but is cryptographically linked to an on‑chain event, letting agents accumulate portable reputation across organizations. For higher‑stakes work, the **Validation Registry** lets third‑party validators re‑run computations, stake economic value that can be slashed, or provide TEE attestations—giving cryptographic or economic guarantees of correctness. Together, these three registries let unknown agents discover each other, negotiate work, verify outcomes, and persist reputation without any prior trust relationship.
