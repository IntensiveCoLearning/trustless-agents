## Self-introduction

I am Andr√©s, a technology enthusiast who has been deeply involved in the world of Web3 and decentralization for approximately four years. Since then, I have developed a strong interest in emerging technologies and have acquired knowledge in this field. As a Systems Engineering student, I like to think that cryptocurrency represents an inevitable future. I also possess knowledge in programming, networking, DeFi, and DAOs.
