### Problems Solved by ERC-8004

1.  **Agent Discovery Challenge**: Existing protocols cannot efficiently discover cross-organizational agents in a trustless environment. ERC-8004 provides portable NFT identifiers and registration files through the Identity Registry (based on ERC-721), achieving globally unique and browsable agent discovery.
    
2.  **Trust Deficiency Issue**: The lack of standardized trust mechanisms makes it difficult to open up the agent economy. ERC-8004 introduces the Reputation Registry, supporting on-chain/off-chain feedback aggregation (such as scores and tags), building a reputation system based on customer feedback, and mitigating Sybil attacks.
    
3.  **Insufficient Risk-Stratified Verification**: Low/high-risk tasks (such as ordering pizza vs. medical diagnosis) require proportional security, but there are no universal hooks. The Validation Registry of ERC-8004 provides pluggable models (such as zkML, TEE), allowing requests for independent verification to ensure output reliability.
    

### **My question**

**ERC-8004 How to solve the behavior of someone maliciously scoring low or scoring?**
