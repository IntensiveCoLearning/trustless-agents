I think I have pretty good high-level understanding of ERC-8004 so far. To me, it is essentially an onchain verifiable A2A (although I am also aware that it has been extended to other protocols, like MCP) providing clients a trustless environment to ensure AI agents are doing exactly what they are intended for.

As a smart contract developer, I am particularly interested in figuring out about integrating existing workflow for TEE attestations, or any other cryptographic verification primitives into the Validation Registry contract.

Looking forward to learning more through the courses.
