**Identity Registry** - A minimal on-chain handle based on [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) with URIStorage extension that resolves to an agent’s registration file, providing every agent with a portable, censorship-resistant identifier.

**Reputation Registry** - A standard interface for posting and fetching feedback signals. Scoring and aggregation occur both on-chain (for composability) and off-chain (for sophisticated algorithms), enabling an ecosystem of specialized services for agent scoring, auditor networks, and insurance pools.

**Validation Registry** - Generic hooks for requesting and recording independent validators checks (e.g. stakers re-running the job, zkML verifiers, TEE oracles, trusted judges).
