# Google:: A2A protocol

### Overview

Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol (announced April 9, 2025) standardizes AI agent communication over HTTP(S) with JSON-RPC 2.0. It enables discovery, task delegation, and secure collaboration across providers. Open-source on GitHub (v0.3.0).

Benefits: Interoperability, discoverability via Agent Cards, built-in security (OAuth2, API keys).

See [official spec](https://github.com/google/A2A).

### Core Components

**Agent Cards: Agent “Profiles”**

JSON metadata published by server agents; fetched by clients for discovery.

Example JSON snippet:

```
{
  "protocolVersion": "0.3.0",
  "name": "Travel Planner",
  "skills": [{ "id": "flight-book", "tags": ["travel"] }]
}
```

**Task Flow**  
User inputs natural language to client agent, which discovers servers via cards, delegates subtasks, aggregates outcomes.

**_Mermaid Diagram_**:

Steps: Input → Discover → Delegate (JSON-RPC) → Execute → Synthesize.

**Human Social Analogy**

A2A mirrors social norms for smooth teamwork.

| A2A Element | Social Equivalent | Parallel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Card | Resume/Business Card | Quick fit-check |
| Task Distribution | Party Delegation | Assign roles via tags |
| Generic Input | Casual Chat | No jargon; interpret |
| Outcomes | Follow-Ups | Accountability loop |

Like a networking event: Host (client agent) scouts profiles and divides labor.

**Implementation**

-   **Server**: Serve card at /.well-known/agent.json; handle JSON-RPC.
    
-   **Client**：Fetch/parse cards; route tasks.
    
-   **Python Snippet**：
    

```
  import requests
  card = requests.get("https://example.com/.well-known/agent.json").json()
  print(card["skills"])
```

### Conclusion

**_What is protocol ？  
It’s just rules in AI as same as rules in human society.What is Protocol —> It’s just rules in AI as same as rules in human society._**

## 1\. Why Should We Adopt Trustless Mechanisms?

Current AI Agents are predominantly centralized “black boxes”—opaque systems controlled by a few large entities (e.g., tech giants like OpenAI or Google), where users have little visibility into decision-making processes, data handling, or potential biases. This centralization creates trust barriers: without transparency, users must blindly rely on the provider for reliability, security, and ethical alignment, especially in cross-organizational multi-agent collaboration scenarios. EIP-8004 addresses this by enabling trustless interactions via blockchain, fostering an open agent economy where agents can discover and collaborate without pre-existing relationships. The motivation is to scale AI beyond silos, using pluggable trust models (e.g., reputation or validation) proportional to risk—from low-stake tasks like simple queries to high-stake ones like diagnostics—while ensuring censorship-resistant discovery and verifiable signals.

## 2\. How to Solve Trustlessness?  

To make AI Agents truly trustless, data and interactions must be open, verifiable, and tamper-proof, which blockchain excels at by providing immutable, decentralized ledgers. EIP-8004 solves this through three interconnected on-chain registries (Identity, Reputation, and Validation) deployed as ERC-721-based smart contracts on Ethereum Mainnet or L2s. These registries ensure data authenticity via hashes (e.g., KECCAK-256 for IPFS files), signed authorizations (EIP-191/ERC-1271), and public events for composability. Key ideas:  

-   **Open Data**: Agent metadata (e.g., capabilities, endpoints) is stored off-chain (IPFS/HTTP) but committed on-chain via URIs, making it browsable and auditable.
    
-   **Truth Assurance:** Blockchain consensus verifies identities and signals (e.g., feedback scores 0-100), mitigating Sybil attacks through filtering and stake-secured validation.
    
-   **Pluggable Models**: Choose reputation (client feedback), crypto-economic validation (staked re-execution), zkML proofs, or TEE oracles—tiered by risk.
    

This integration turns centralized black boxes into decentralized, verifiable systems, aligning with your point on open, true data via blockchain.

## 3\. What is the Normal Workflow for a Trustless Agent?

  
The trustless agent workflow in EIP-8004 follows a structured, iterative process emphasizing discovery, interaction, and verification without central authority. It builds on off-chain protocols like A2A (for messaging) and MCP (for capabilities), with on-chain enforcement for trust. Here’s the standard flow:

![WHY.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntensiveCoLearning/trustless-agents/main/assets/niko4570/images/2025-10-15-1760505126541-WHY.png)

| Step | Description | Key Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Discovery | Client agent (user or orchestrator) queries the Identity Registry (ERC-721) to browse agents by ID. Resolves tokenURI to an off-chain JSON file for details like endpoints (e.g., A2A URL), skills, and supportedTrust (e.g., “reputation”). Filter by reputation/validation summaries from other registries. | Identity Registry; Global ID: (eip155, chainId, registryAddr, agentId). |
| 2. Selection & Interaction | Client selects a server agent based on trust signals (e.g., avg score >80). Initiates task via off-chain endpoint (e.g., A2A message for orchestration). Server executes (e.g., AI computation) and returns artifacts. | Off-chain: A2A/MCP; On-chain: Pre-check summaries. Roles: Client (requester), Server (provider). |
| 3. Feedback (Reputation Model) | Post-task, server signs a feedbackAuth tuple (agentId, clientAddr, indexLimit, expiry, etc.). Client submits to Reputation Registry: giveFeedback(score, tags, fileuri, hash, auth). Optional: Revoke or append responses. | Reputation Registry; Emits NewFeedback; Aggregates via getSummary. |
| 4. Validation (If Needed) | For high-risk tasks, server (or client) requests via Validation Registry: validationRequest(validatorAddr, agentId, requestUri, hash). Independent validator (e.g., staker or zk-prover) re-executes/verifies and responds: validationResponse(hash, score, responseUri, tag). Client queries status. | Validation Registry; Emits ValidationRequest/Response; Models: zkML, TEE. Role: Validator (verifier). |
| 5. Iteration & Settlement | Use aggregates for future selections. Payments orthogonal (e.g., x402 proofs in feedback files). Loop for multi-agent chains. | Cross-chain via multi-registrations; Gas sponsorship (EIP-7702) for ease. |

This workflow ensures accountability: low-trust tasks rely on reputation; high-trust add validation, all verifiable on-chain.
