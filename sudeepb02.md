## Self-introduction

Iâ€™m Sudeep, a blockchain enthusiast and smart contract developer with over six years of experience building on EVM chains. Over the years, I've worked across a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) domains, such as yield farming, cross-chain messaging, lending-borrowing, perps and yield trading protocols. I've also worked on developing subgraphs on The Graph Network, to make on-chain data more accessible and usable.

My focus is on building solutions that solve real problems, even if makes the existing system better by just 1%, that's still a win. I'm excited about blockchains, and truly believe that it has the potential to reshape how existing systems work, specially in Traditional Finance (TradFi).
