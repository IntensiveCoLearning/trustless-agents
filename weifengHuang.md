## Self-introduction

I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in Web3, AI, and automation. I’ve previously participated in AI-agent development, but haven’t yet explored integrating AI with Web3. Through this program, I hope to gain hands-on experience and collaborate on practical projects that bridge these two fields.

I studied [EIP-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004).

EIP-8004 builds on **A2A** and extends it by introducing modules for **registration, verification, and reputation scoring**.

It does **not restrict how agents are developed** — instead, it provides a framework that enables agents to be **discovered on-chain**.
