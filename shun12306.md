# ERC-8004 defines **three lightweight on-chain registries**:

1.  **Identity Registry** – assigns each agent a unique, portable `AgentID` linking its Ethereum address and domain (with an off-chain AgentCard).
    
2.  **Reputation Registry** – logs feedback authorization events between agents; actual ratings live off-chain for flexibility and scalability.
    
3.  **Validation Registry** – supports validation through staking, re-execution, or cryptographic proofs (like TEE attestations).
