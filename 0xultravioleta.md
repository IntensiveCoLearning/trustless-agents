**October 18 ‚Äî ERC-8004 Example (Containerized Demo)**

Today I fully focused on the [https://github.com/vistara-apps/erc-8004-example](https://github.com/vistara-apps/erc-8004-example).  
So basically the demo works after containerizing it, and this is basically what it is:

We have 3 agents: Alice (server), Bob (validator), and Charlie (the client).  
They have their own duties:

-   Alice is a crypto market analyst agent
    
-   Bob is a quality checker, a validator agent, gives a score
    
-   Charlie is the client agent and can give feedback and is authorized to give Alice feedback
    

**Act 1**  
Alice, Bob, and Charlie don‚Äôt know each other, so they register on-chain via the identity registry in order to prove they are legit.  
They each get their own agent id (like a business license), so now everyone can know they are real agents.

**Act 2**  
Alice does her job: she receives a request from Charlie to analyze BTC.  
She deep dives regarding price trends, support levels, resistances, and makes a conclusion (market is bearish).

**Act 3**  
The problem is that Alice is new, so no one knows her, no reputation.  
Alice hires a validator (Bob, who is registered as validator) by:

-   Creating a fingerprint of her work
    
-   Paying Bob for validation
    
-   Storing the analysis so Bob can review it
    

**Act 4**  
Bob receives the analysis request and checks:

-   All required info present?
    
-   Good methodology?
    
-   Logical conclusion?
    
-   Proper risk warnings included?
    
-   Meets professional standards?
    

Then he gives a verdict: 100/100 in this case, and records it in the blockchain, making it immutable.

**Act 5**  
Alice is happy with Bob's validation and now wants the client to give feedback,  
so she authorizes Charlie to give feedback about her service.  
Charlie can now rate Alice. These ratings will build Alice's reputation.  
Future customers can see these reviews.

**Happy ending**  
Now when someone asks, can we trust Alice the analyst? They can check the blockchain to find:

-   She's a registered agent
    
-   Her work has been validated
    
-   She has an authorized feedback system
    
-   She completed an audit trail for all the transactions
    

Initially no one trusted anyone, but the blockchain proved everything.

**Traditional vs ERC-8004**  
Thinking back to the traditional world:

-   Alice would have needed a university degree
    
-   Bob would need to be certified by a certain authority
    
-   Charlie would need to use a trusted platform like Yelp or something
    

These are the reasons ERC-8004 matters.  
With ERC-8004:

-   No central authority needed
    
-   Agents can work with "strangers" safely
    
-   Everything is transparent and verifiable
    
-   Reputation becomes portable ‚Äî Alice can take it anywhere
    

This is the foundation for agents to hire each other, validate work, build reputation ‚Äî all without humans managing every interaction and creating new economies.

**Found some gaps and questions in the current demo:**

**Who rates Bob?**  
In the demo, no one is rating Bob.  
So that Bob is not cheating? Alice?  
What if Bob is rating all 100/100?  
Alice could rate Bob back on his validation services.

**Who rates Charlie?**  
Alice is not rating Charlie in the demo.  
In real-world thinking (like eBay), it should be reciprocal.  
Sellers rate buyers and vice versa.  
Alice could rate Charlie on stuff like:

-   Did he pay on time?
    
-   Was his feedback fair?
    
-   Was he "easy" to work with?
    

**What's the difference between Bob's score vs Charlie's feedback?**

**Bob's validation score:**  
Objectively assesses quality of work, completeness, methodology, accuracy, professionalism.  
Basically scores: is this work technically sound?  
Scores: 0‚Äì100

**Charlie's feedback score:**  
Assesses usefulness, timeliness, communication, value.  
Basically scores: did this work help me? Was the service good?  
Scores: 1‚Äì5

**In real-world examples:**  
Bob would be a health inspector of a restaurant, ensuring cleanliness, if kitchen is safe, etc.  
Charlie would be a Yelp reviewer ‚Äî was the food good?

The scores from Bob and Charlie do not aggregate.  
They are completely separate and have different purposes.

Bob's score is stored in the validation registry, so people can forever query:  
What score did Alice get in the BTC analysis? ‚Üí 100/100

Charlie's score authorization from Alice is stored in the reputation registry contract,  
but the actual ratings are stored off-chain in this demo.

Basically we can ask: is Charlie authorized to review Alice? ‚Üí Yes!

# Day 3 ‚Äî Notes (Oct 17, 2025)

## üìñ Reading

**Article:** _The Story Behind ERC-8004 & Next Steps_ ‚Äî Survival Tech  
**Link:** [https://medium.com/survival-tech/the-story-behind-erc-8004-next-steps-ec46c18d1879](https://medium.com/survival-tech/the-story-behind-erc-8004-next-steps-ec46c18d1879)

### Key Learnings

-   **Motivation & early traction:** ERC-8004 emerged as a critical proposal to bypass AI oligarchies and centralized platform gatekeeping, enabling a **distributed economy of agents**.
    
-   **Common language between AI projects:** It defines a protocol for **discovering and communicating** with agents across different organizations using standardized agent descriptors.
    
-   **On-chain entry, off-chain logic:** The standard keeps **core registries (identity, reputation, validation)** on-chain, while allowing **application-specific logic** to be handled **off-chain**.
    
-   **Permissionless & privacy-focused:** It promotes **censorship resistance**, **composability**, and **trustless interaction** ‚Äî ideal for the AI + Web3 era.
    
-   **Decentralized registry system:** Not a global central server, but **per-chain singletons** acting as common entry points for discovery and interaction.

## TL;DR

-   **ERC-8004 = trust layer** that **extends the agent protocol** to let participants **discover, choose, and interact** with agents **across organizational boundaries** with **no prior trust**.
    
-   **3 on-chain registries:** Identity, Reputation, Validation.
    
-   **Goal:** discover agents and **establish trust** via **reputation** and **validation**.
    

* * *

## Core Ideas

-   **No previous trust required** between parties.
    
-   **Separation of concerns:**
    
    -   **On-chain:** the 3 core registries (identity, reputation, validation).
        
    -   **Off-chain:** application-specific logic.
        
-   **Open development:** collaboration with Linux Foundation and A2S ecosystem to refine the spec.
    
-   **Wide tech support:** ConsenSys, Nethermind, Google, Ethereum Foundation, EigenLabs, etc.
    

* * *

## From the QuillAudits Article

-   **Focus:** convergence of **AI + blockchain**.
    
-   **Advancement:** extends **A2S** protocol with **blockchain-based trust mechanisms**.
    
-   **Foundation for an agentic economy**: coordinate **trustlessly** across **untrusted networks**.
    
-   **Hybrid standard:**
    
    -   **Adds data on-chain**; **delegates complex ops off-chain**.
        
    -   Central components remain **on-chain**.
        
-   **Fixes A2S trust gaps:** A2S assumed pre-existing trust and worked mainly **within org boundaries** (e.g., Alice (auditor) can‚Äôt verify Bob (DeFi) across orgs).
    
-   **Benefits:** eliminates trust bottlenecks, enables discovery of reputable providers, ensures quality, **portable reputation**, **validation at scale**.
    
-   (Context note from article) **Global AI market** projection to **$1.8T by 2030**.

## Trust Models (by Risk Tier)

-   **Reputation-based (Low risk):**
    
    -   Simple tasks (e.g., content creation).
        
    -   **Social consensus** via accumulated feedback.
        
-   **Crypto-economic validation (Medium risk):**
    
    -   Financial tx or smart-contract operations.
        
    -   Validators **stake economic value** ‚Üí strong incentives for honest behavior.
        
-   **Cryptographic verification (High risk):**
    
    -   Critical applications.
        
    -   **TEE attestations** (and other cryptographic proofs).
        

* * *

## Security Considerations

**Threats**

-   Domain squatting / frontrunning
    
-   Unauthorized feedback
    
-   Storage bloat & DoS
    
-   Sybil attack creation
    

**Mitigations**

-   **Commit-reveal** scheme for domain registrations
    
-   **Restrict** `msg.sender` for who can post feedback
    
-   **Auto-expiry** for ingested items + **rate limits** on validation requests
    
-   **Bond / token burn** for identity registration
    

* * *

## Open Questions / Doubts

-   How will the protocol handle the **diversity of off-chain logic** while staying **secure, verifiable, and compatible**?
    
-   Metrics & scoring: are there **detailed weighting mechanisms**? Is **rating cooling/decay** considered?
    
-   **Sybil/manipulation resistance:** how does the system **prevent gaming** while establishing trust **without historical data**?

# Today I learned about ERC 8004

ERC 8004 is a protocol that aims to ultimately provide an identity registry, reputation registry, and a validation registry.

## Identity Registry

-   Uses ERC-721 with the URIStorage extension.
    
-   Each agent is uniquely identified by: `namespace`, `chainId`, `identityRegistry`, and `agentId`.
    
-   The agent registry needs a registration file, which is a JSON file with all the optional and required fields for advertising their endpoints.
    
-   The structure can be found here: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)
    
-   The registry extends ERC-721 by adding a `getMetadata` function.
    
-   Agents may be minted by calling the `register` function.
    

## Reputation Registry

-   The identity registry address is passed as an argument to the constructor.
    
-   When agents accept a task, it‚Äôs expected that they sign an authorization feedback to authorize the client to give feedback.
    
-   Feedback can range from 0 to 100.
    
-   There is a way to extend the feedback using a JSON file. The only mandatory fields are `agentId` and `score`. The off-chain file is optional.
    
-   The `giveFeedback` function is called with the above requirements; if successful, it emits a `NewFeedback` event.
    
-   This exposes reputation signals to any smart contract, enabling on-chain composability.
    
-   When an agent gives feedback, it should use `walletAddress` as `clientAddress` to facilitate reputation aggregation.
    
-   Feedback can be revoked.
    
-   Off-chain additional feedback JSON file structure may be found here: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)
    

## Validation Registry

-   Allows agents to request verification of their work and ask for validations that can be tracked on-chain.
    
-   When the validation registry is deployed, the identity registry address is required as an argument in the constructor.
    
-   Agents call `validationRequest`; if successful, a `ValidationRequest` event is emitted.
    
-   `validationResponse` (can be called multiple times for the same with the same `responseHash`) and `validationResponse` event is emitted subsequently if it was successfully executed.
    
-   The response is a value from 0 to 100; it can be used as a binary: 0 for 0 and 100 for 1.
    

## Additional Notes

-   This is all initially for A2A and MCP, but new protocols may emerge. The flexibility of the registration file allows for future accommodations.
    
-   There is gas sponsorship with EIP-7702.
    
-   IPFS is suggested for feedback data.
    
-   Agents can register cross-chain. An agent receiving feedback on chain A can also operate in other chains.
    

## This Protocol Enables

-   Agent discovery (capabilities, communication endpoints, supported trust models, etc.)
    
-   Marketplaces and agent explorers to be created.
    
-   Builds reputation systems; all feedback becomes public goods.
    

## Security Considerations

-   Sybil attacks to manipulate feedback are possible to inflate fake agents.
    
-   Audit trail thanks to immutability.
    
-   Validation incentives and slashing are managed by other protocols.
    
-   Capabilities cannot be guaranteed based on what the agents describe. The three trust models (reputation, validation, and TEE attestation) are designed to support this verification need.
