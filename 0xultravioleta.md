# Day 2 — ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents) — Study Notes

**Sources**

## TL;DR

-   **ERC-8004 = trust layer** that **extends the agent protocol** to let participants **discover, choose, and interact** with agents **across organizational boundaries** with **no prior trust**.
    
-   **3 on-chain registries:** Identity, Reputation, Validation.
    
-   **Goal:** discover agents and **establish trust** via **reputation** and **validation**.
    

* * *

## Core Ideas

-   **No previous trust required** between parties.
    
-   **Separation of concerns:**
    
    -   **On-chain:** the 3 core registries (identity, reputation, validation).
        
    -   **Off-chain:** application-specific logic.
        
-   **Open development:** collaboration with Linux Foundation and A2S ecosystem to refine the spec.
    
-   **Wide tech support:** ConsenSys, Nethermind, Google, Ethereum Foundation, EigenLabs, etc.

## From the QuillAudits Article

-   **Focus:** convergence of **AI + blockchain**.
    
-   **Advancement:** extends **A2S** protocol with **blockchain-based trust mechanisms**.
    
-   **Foundation for an agentic economy**: coordinate **trustlessly** across **untrusted networks**.
    
-   **Hybrid standard:**
    
    -   **Adds data on-chain**; **delegates complex ops off-chain**.
        
    -   Central components remain **on-chain**.
        
-   **Fixes A2S trust gaps:** A2S assumed pre-existing trust and worked mainly **within org boundaries** (e.g., Alice (auditor) can’t verify Bob (DeFi) across orgs).
    
-   **Benefits:** eliminates trust bottlenecks, enables discovery of reputable providers, ensures quality, **portable reputation**, **validation at scale**.
    
-   (Context note from article) **Global AI market** projection to **$1.8T by 2030**.

## Trust Models (by Risk Tier)

-   **Reputation-based (Low risk):**
    
    -   Simple tasks (e.g., content creation).
        
    -   **Social consensus** via accumulated feedback.
        
-   **Crypto-economic validation (Medium risk):**
    
    -   Financial tx or smart-contract operations.
        
    -   Validators **stake economic value** → strong incentives for honest behavior.
        
-   **Cryptographic verification (High risk):**
    
    -   Critical applications.
        
    -   **TEE attestations** (and other cryptographic proofs).

## Security Considerations

**Threats**

-   Domain squatting / frontrunning
    
-   Unauthorized feedback
    
-   Storage bloat & DoS
    
-   Sybil attack creation
    

**Mitigations**

-   **Commit-reveal** scheme for domain registrations
    
-   **Restrict** `msg.sender` for who can post feedback
    
-   **Auto-expiry** for ingested items + **rate limits** on validation requests
    
-   **Bond / token burn** for identity registration
    

* * *

## Open Questions / Doubts

-   How will the protocol handle the **diversity of off-chain logic** while staying **secure, verifiable, and compatible**?
    
-   Metrics & scoring: are there **detailed weighting mechanisms**? Is **rating cooling/decay** considered?
    
-   **Sybil/manipulation resistance:** how does the system **prevent gaming** while establishing trust **without historical data**?

# Today I learned about ERC 8004

ERC 8004 is a protocol that aims to ultimately provide an identity registry, reputation registry, and a validation registry.

## Identity Registry

-   Uses ERC-721 with the URIStorage extension.
    
-   Each agent is uniquely identified by: `namespace`, `chainId`, `identityRegistry`, and `agentId`.
    
-   The agent registry needs a registration file, which is a JSON file with all the optional and required fields for advertising their endpoints.
    
-   The structure can be found here: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)
    
-   The registry extends ERC-721 by adding a `getMetadata` function.
    
-   Agents may be minted by calling the `register` function.
    

## Reputation Registry

-   The identity registry address is passed as an argument to the constructor.
    
-   When agents accept a task, it’s expected that they sign an authorization feedback to authorize the client to give feedback.
    
-   Feedback can range from 0 to 100.
    
-   There is a way to extend the feedback using a JSON file. The only mandatory fields are `agentId` and `score`. The off-chain file is optional.
    
-   The `giveFeedback` function is called with the above requirements; if successful, it emits a `NewFeedback` event.
    
-   This exposes reputation signals to any smart contract, enabling on-chain composability.
    
-   When an agent gives feedback, it should use `walletAddress` as `clientAddress` to facilitate reputation aggregation.
    
-   Feedback can be revoked.
    
-   Off-chain additional feedback JSON file structure may be found here: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)
    

## Validation Registry

-   Allows agents to request verification of their work and ask for validations that can be tracked on-chain.
    
-   When the validation registry is deployed, the identity registry address is required as an argument in the constructor.
    
-   Agents call `validationRequest`; if successful, a `ValidationRequest` event is emitted.
    
-   `validationResponse` (can be called multiple times for the same with the same `responseHash`) and `validationResponse` event is emitted subsequently if it was successfully executed.
    
-   The response is a value from 0 to 100; it can be used as a binary: 0 for 0 and 100 for 1.
    

## Additional Notes

-   This is all initially for A2A and MCP, but new protocols may emerge. The flexibility of the registration file allows for future accommodations.
    
-   There is gas sponsorship with EIP-7702.
    
-   IPFS is suggested for feedback data.
    
-   Agents can register cross-chain. An agent receiving feedback on chain A can also operate in other chains.
    

## This Protocol Enables

-   Agent discovery (capabilities, communication endpoints, supported trust models, etc.)
    
-   Marketplaces and agent explorers to be created.
    
-   Builds reputation systems; all feedback becomes public goods.
    

## Security Considerations

-   Sybil attacks to manipulate feedback are possible to inflate fake agents.
    
-   Audit trail thanks to immutability.
    
-   Validation incentives and slashing are managed by other protocols.
    
-   Capabilities cannot be guaranteed based on what the agents describe. The three trust models (reputation, validation, and TEE attestation) are designed to support this verification need.
