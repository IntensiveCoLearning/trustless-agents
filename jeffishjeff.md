### Learning ERC-8004

ERC-8004, also known as **“Trustless Agents,”** is a proposed Ethereum standard designed to enable autonomous or AI-driven agents to safely interact, transact, and collaborate with each other **without requiring pre-established trust**. It builds on the earlier Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol by introducing a **lightweight on-chain trust framework**, allowing agents from different domains or organizations to coordinate in an open ecosystem.

At its core, ERC-8004 defines three minimal registries: **Identity**, **Reputation**, and **Validation**. The **Identity Registry** lets agents publish verified metadata about who they are and what they can do; the **Reputation Registry** records community feedback after interactions; and the **Validation Registry** provides a mechanism for independent validators to attest that an agent’s claimed actions or outputs are correct. These registries serve as a shared trust substrate while leaving application-specific logic, payments, and data off-chain.

The motivation behind ERC-8004 is the rise of the **machine economy**—a world where AI agents negotiate services, exchange value, or manage digital assets on behalf of humans or organizations. By standardizing identity, reputation, and validation interfaces, ERC-8004 aims to make such autonomous systems interoperable and auditable across blockchains. In essence, it turns Ethereum into the **trust layer for AI and autonomous agents**, providing a minimal, composable foundation for decentralized cooperation between machines.
