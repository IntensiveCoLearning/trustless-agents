EIP-8004 basically introduces a **trustless framework for agent networks** on Ethereum.  
It lets different agents (like AI agents, service bots, validators, etc.) **register, build reputation, and prove their trustworthiness** — all without relying on a centralized platform.

-   **Identity Registry** – every agent gets a unique on-chain ID (like an NFT) with metadata about who they are and what they do.
    
-   **Reputation Registry** – users can leave feedback, ratings, or tags about how reliable that agent is.
    
-   **Validation Registry** – lets others verify the agent’s work (through re-execution, ZK proofs, or TEE attestations).
    

-   Agents can be discovered and trusted **across apps and ecosystems**, not locked into one platform.
    
-   Different levels of trust are possible — from simple reputation scores to cryptographic or hardware-based proofs.
    
-   It could become the foundation for **agent marketplaces** where humans, bots, and DAOs trade services safely.
