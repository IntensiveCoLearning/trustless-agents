First day, I tried to read the ERC-8004 original document, and haven't finished.

> This protocol proposes to use blockchains to **discover, choose, and interact with agents across organizational boundaries** without pre-existing trust, thus **enabling open-ended agent economies**.

Different trust models can be used according to requirement:

-   Reputation systems using client feedback
    
-   Validation via stake-secured re-execution
    
-   zkML proofs, or TEE oracles
    

Would continue tomorrow.
