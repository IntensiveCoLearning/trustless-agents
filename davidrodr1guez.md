## Self-introduction

Hi everyone! My name is David, and I’m excited to be part of this programming course. I’m passionate about technology and eager to improve my coding skills to build real-world projects. I’m especially interested in how AI and automation can make people’s lives easier. I’m looking forward to learning from all of you and collaborating on creative ideas.

Notes – ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents)

ERC-8004 is a proposal that allows agents (AI, bots, etc.) to interact with each other without needing prior trust. The idea is to use blockchain to manage identity, reputation, and validation — basically building an “open economy of agents.”

Main Structure

There are three main registries that make the system work:

Identity Registry

Each agent is registered as an NFT (ERC-721).

The NFT stores basic info about the agent (name, description, endpoints, image, etc.).

It helps identify and discover agents easily.

Reputation Registry

Lets users or agents leave ratings (0–100) and comments about others.

Data is stored both on-chain and off-chain for deeper analysis.

Reviews can be revoked or replied to.

Validation Registry

Agents can request to have their work verified.

Validators can use staking, zkML, or TEE oracles to check results.

Everything is recorded on-chain and can be audited.

Trust Models

Reputation: based on user or agent feedback.

Crypto-economic validation: through staking or proofs.

TEE attestation: done in secure environments.

Agents can use one or more of these models depending on the type of task.

Possible Uses

Marketplaces or explorers for agents.

Public and transparent reputation systems.

On-chain validation for AI outputs.

Collaboration between agents from different networks or organizations.

Security & Limitations

Data can’t be deleted — full traceability.

Risk of Sybil attacks (fake identities).

Doesn’t guarantee that an agent works well, only that its identity and reputation are verifiable.

Incentive and penalty mechanisms for validators aren’t defined yet.

Summary

In short, ERC-8004 aims to create a framework where agents can work together without relying on trust. It uses NFTs for identity, public feedback for reputation, and verifiable validation processes to make interactions between agents more transparent and reliable.
